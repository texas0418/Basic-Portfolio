                                I was born in December of 1970 in San Antonio, Texas. My parents moved us to the Clear
                                Lake part of Houston not long after I was born, where I spend most of my childhood. I
                                quit school my freshman year of high school and got my GED the year after and ended up
                                at a trade school in Waco, Texas, where I got an associate’s degree in computer
                                maintenance.

                                My work career is extensive and in different areas as I could not keep a job and moved
                                around a lot. I worked as a computer technician, graphic designer, in restaurants, in
                                bars, sales, and presently in the oil and gas industry. Recently I decided that my
                                career path wasn’t one I wanted to continue to follow, so I decided to go back to
                                school for coding and cybersecurity.

                                I have many hobbies, but ultimately, I enjoy learned and building. The Raspberry Pi has
                                opened up a whole new world of possibilities and I just completed my Smart Mirror
                                build. I also make RetroPie gaming systems with the Pi board. My other hobbies include
                                collecting comics; mostly graded and key issues. Building and modifying motorcycle; I
                                am presently working on a cafe racer based on an old 1978 Honda CB750K frame. And one
                                of my next projects is building a home server lab to help with getting my cybersecurity
                                certification.
